# React Chat 
https://reactchat-d04a6.web.app/login

This project was built so that I could practice my React skills and develop them further. It also helped me learn about tools like Tailwind.css and Firebase Hosting, Realtime Database, and Authentication.

Currently only has a single giant group chat where everyone who is logged in via Google can talk to each other in realtime.
